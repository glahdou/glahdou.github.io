One of the strategies proposed for reducing nitrate losses from subsurface tile drain systems in Midwestern agricultural lands, controlled drainage, is known to reduce drain flow on an annual basis, but is not well understood for individual events. Understanding hydrologic controls that regulate outflow from free and controlled drainage systems during drainage events can offer improved insight on the overall functioning of these systems so that they can be better managed or retrofitted to increase their environmental benefits. This study used data from a monitoring site in east central Indiana to investigate the hydrology of 22 drainage events in free and controlled subsurface drainage systems. Relationships between event drainage volume, drain flow hydrograph metrics, column soil moisture, water table depth, and precipitation time series for each event were explored to determine the effect of precipitation characteristics and antecedent conditions on these metrics. Controlled drainage reduced event drainage volume and peak flows by 22% ± 12% and 29% ± 16% respectively, and increased the time to peak of drainage by 98% ± 52%. Higher total precipitation and precipitation time spread increased infiltration, while the average precipitation intensity did not correlate with drainage volumes in either system. Peak flow rate in free draining quadrants were positively affected by higher precipitation and average precipitation intensity, while in managed quadrants, the antecedent soil moisture appeared to be more influential in affecting peak flow rate than precipitation characteristics. Surface runoff potential increased with the increase in average precipitation intensity in all quadrants. Saturation excess ponding or possibly overland flow occurred in events that have a low average precipitation intensity, and a high precipitation time spread. Field observations indicate that saturation excess overland flow was more pronounced in controlled quadrants because water table levels rose higher than the water table levels of their free draining counterpart.

TRANSDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE Agriculture in the twenty-first century faces unprecedented challenges from increasing climate variability to growing demands on natural resources to globalizing economic markets. These emerging agricultural issues, spanning both human and natural dimensions, are uniquely formulated, exceedingly complex, and difficult to address within existing disciplinary domains (Eigenbrode et al. 2007; Reganold et al. 2011; Foley et al. 2005; Hansen et al. 2013). Therefore, the next generation of scientists working on these issues must not only be highly trained within a disciplinary context but must also have the capacity to collaborate with others to solve systems-level problems.

Paper Submitted and Presented at the *Tenth Faculty of Engineering and Architecture Student Conference*, May 18-19 2011, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon (Achieved 1st Place
for Best Paper out of 25 teams) [[Poster Website](https://feaweb.aub.edu.lb/feasac/10/PDFs/GBouLahdou_YHraoui_ROmeiche_FRached_ISaadeh_MAROUAHINE.pdf)]

This  community  development  project  branches  out  from  an  idea  adopted  by  the  Center  for  Civic  Engagement  and  Community  Service (CCECS). It aims at reclaiming traditional water conservation practices in rural south Lebanon by repairing and developing traditional village open reservoirs, thus raising awareness of their value under the umbrella of environmental sustainability. The research initiative develops a methodological framework for assessing, quantifying and documenting proper and feasible plans for promoting sustainable water resource management in “Marouahine”. This framework provides solutions to the existing problem by incorporating data collection (surveys, soil tests, etc) and financial engineering to address the important challenge of rehabilitating the major water source in the village. The water balance of the village’s pond was analyzed. The various components of the water balance that were studied are infiltration, evapora-tion, irrigation water consumption and the volume of storm water runoff that is reaching the pond. A HEC-HMS hydrological model was devel-oped in order to estimate the resulting runoff into the pond. Accordingly, three scenarios were modeled, ‘sub-basin 1 unimproved’ which is the base condition of the pond’s watershed, ‘sub-basin 1 improved’ which is the pond’s watershed in which a stormwater channel is introduced, and ‘sub-basin 2’  which is a separate solution from ‘sub-basin 1’. Finally, based on the obtained results, the proposed stormwater channel was designed, and recommendations were made.

*Project resulted in the re-construction of a rural stormwater/irrigation pond that was funded by a $40,000 grant from the UNDP-Coca Cola Foundation.*
